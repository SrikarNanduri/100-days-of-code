### R1D1 

#### Day 0: Feb 13, Tue

Recently started doing Hacker Rank 30 days of code for improving my java skills and get a better understanding of logic building. Now I'm on day 15 challenge and going forward with it. I'm trying to complete as many days as possible on a single go. 

**Thoughts**: I'm really struggling with the codes and honestly I'm not able to complete it on my own. I have the idea on how to go forward with the code but I'm not good with implementing that idea exactly in the code. I need to get better at writing the syntax's and writing the code instead of copy pasting it. Basic programming is totally fine but when the logic gets a bit complex I'm tending to go out of my mind and searching for the solution instead of trying to solve it. These are my basic thoughts looking forward to improve myself.

### R1D2

Today is my first day in Google India Challenge Scholarship: Android Developer and it's a 3 months scholarship program. I have completed 11% of the course today, it's mostly basics of android development basics. Done some forking of the resources into GitHub and worked on them. Also worked on 30 days of code of Hacker Rank and completed it till day 18.

**Thoughts**: I'm Kinda overwhelmed with the slack group of Google India Challenge Scholarship and was not sure if I can go on support and help others as there are some people who are experienced but I think I just need to learn and try to support others that's how everyone started out. As for the 30 days of code challenges I'm still trying to copy paste the code and read it and understand it but not completely trying to code on my own but it's a good start. I think this 100DaysOfCode is helping me out in finding my weak points and reflect on them. That's the end of day 2 and yes, I feel good about my work till now.

### R1D3

Today I just concentrated on doing Google India Challenge Scholarship's lesson 3 and completed it. I learned about Uri, Logging messages, Async tasks, adding internet permission to the app and etc., was a haptic day and learned so many new things.

 **Thoughts**: Now I know that there is a lot of things to learn and I really need to work more hard. This 100DaysOfCode is helping me to push myself and do stuff that I generally procrastinate. It's still the same my tendency to copy paste the code and try to make things work, but it's getting less as I'm consciously trying to avoid it and yes it's a bit difficult as it's like a bad habit. Anyways its good to see that I'm progressing.
