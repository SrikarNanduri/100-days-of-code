#### Day 0: Feb 13, Tue

Recently started doing Hacker Rank 30 days of code for improving my java skills and get a better understanding of logic building. Now I'm on day 15 challenge and going forward with it. I'm trying to complete as many days as possible on a single go. 

**Thoughts**: I'm really struggling with the codes and honestly I'm not able to complete it on my own. I have the idea on how to go forward with the code but I'm not good with implementing that idea exactly in the code. I need to get better at writing the syntax's and writing the code instead of copy pasting it. Basic programming is totally fine but when the logic gets a bit complex I'm tending to go out of my mind and searching for the solution instead of trying to solve it. These are my basic thoughts looking forward to improve myself.
